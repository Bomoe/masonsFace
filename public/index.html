                This image is a powerful one, just looking into his eyes you can
                see the boomer confusion surfacing. Personally, this one is so
                important because it can help all of us learn to identify when
                to step in and help our opposites, the boomers. If someone you
                know or love shows this look, you need to be their IT and help
                them close that google chrome tab or explain why their unplugged
                mouse isn't working.

                Here we can see Mason in his natural environment, having fun.
                This is really a good example of how our fearless leader is a
                normal human being like us.

                Now this is an interesting one because when you see this face it
                means he knows something you don't know which is a scary
                thought. Like all zoomers, you don't want to admit when a boomer
                knows something you don't so be prepared to act like you know
                more about it!

                This is a great image as it shows a happy boomer, a rare sight
                to see as they are usually angry about the current market or
                something a zoomer doesn't bother themselves with. This is a
                boomer you can hang out with!!

                This is truly the backbone of any Boomer lifestyle, naps. In
                this instance, the Boomer fought off so many Zoomers they
                collapsed from exhaustion. One day people will finally
                understand their great sacrifice, but until then they will
                probably get meme'd on.
